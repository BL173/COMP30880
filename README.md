Staff Test Set:
Generated by  reading the staff list xlsx file given, and extracting the names of all staff members and whether they were DS focused into a 2 dimensional array. Test sets were then generated by selecting a random number <= array.length, and using the staff member at that index. This was checked against a list of previously used indices, to ensure no staff members were repeated. If the staff member was DS focused, they were assigned 3 DS projects. If they were not, then they were randomly assigned either a CS or a CS + DS project, in a 2:1 ratio. An array of Strings in the form "Name,project,Focus" was made and written to a .txt file in the "TestSets" folder.
